					<h2>Welcome to our Club since 1992</h2>
		Extreme sports (also called action sports and adventurous sports)
					is a popular term for certain activities perceived as having a high 
					level of inherent danger. These activities often involve speed, 
					height, a high level of physical exertion, and highly specialized gear.<br>
					The definition of an extreme sport is not exact and the origin of the term is unclear,
					but it gained popularity in the 1990s when it was picked up by marketing companies 
					to promote the X Games and when the Extreme Sports Channel and Extreme.com launched.<br>
					While use of the term "extreme sport" has spread far and wide to describe a multitude 
					of different activities, exactly which sports are considered 'extreme' is debatable. 
					There are however several characteristics common to most extreme sports. While not 
					the exclusive domain of youth, extreme sports tend to have a younger-than-average 
					target demographic. Extreme sports are rarely sanctioned by schools.[citation needed]
					Extreme sports tend to be more solitary than traditional sports (rafting and paintballing 
					are notable exceptions, as they are done in teams). In addition, beginning extreme athletes 
					tend to work on their craft without the guidance of a coach (though some may hire a coach later).
					Activities categorized by media as extreme sports differ from traditional sports due to the
					higher number of inherently uncontrollable variables. These environmental variables are frequently 
					weather and terrain related, including wind, snow, water and mountains. Because these natural 
					phenomena cannot be controlled, they inevitably affect the outcome of the given activity or event.<br>
					In a traditional sporting event, athletes compete against each other under controlled circumstances. 
					While it is possible to create a controlled sporting event such as X Games, there are environmental 
					variables that cannot be held constant for all athletes. Examples include changing snow conditions 
					for snowboarders, rock and ice quality for climbers, and wave height and shape for surfers.<br>
					Whilst traditional sporting judgment criteria may be adopted when assessing performance (distance,
					time, score, etc.), extreme sports performers are often evaluated on more subjective and aesthetic criteria.
					This results in a tendency to reject unified judging methods, with different sports employing their own 
					ideals and indeed having the ability to evolve their assessment standards with new trends or developments
					in the sports.
